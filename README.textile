h1. Shifter Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Shifter plugin":http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/index?pr=&pluginId=6149
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm, PyCharm CE, AppCode, Android Studio and 0xDBE.


h2. Description

When evoked, shifter detects the type of selection, line or keyword at caret and shifts it "up" or "down".
If there's only one shiftable word in a line, it can be shifted without the caret touching it.
Lowercase/uppercase or lower case with upper first character of shifted words is maintained.
To shift values instantly multiple times, there are additional "Shift More" actions, the amount of repetitions can be configured in the plugin configurations (default: 10).

Shifter adds the following editing tools (you can change the keymap in the IDE preferences):

* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Comma  - Shift-Down
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Period - Shift-Up
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+J  - Shift-Down More
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K  - Shift-Up More

*Mac Users:* On Macs, the keyboard shortcuts are Comma or Period key together with Shift+Alt+Cmd


Supported generic shifting types:

* Shifting a multi-line selection sorts the lines alphabetically ascending/descending.
* Shifting a single-line selection, that is a comma separated list, sorts the items ascending/descending.
* Shifting a selection within a single line (that is not CSV), detects and swaps characters: single quote vs. double quote OR slash vs. backslash
* Numeric values - Increments/decrements numbers by 1
* UNIX (and millisecond based)  timestamps - Increments/decrements by one day, shows a balloon info with the shifted date in human-readable format
* PHP variables - Shifts to alphabetically next/previous variable name found in current document
* Selection of PHP concatenation from two strings / variables - Toggles order of the concatenated parts
* Strings wrapped in single/double quotes and backticks - Shifts to alphabetically next/previous quoted string found in current document
* CSS hex RGB colors - Shifts color value lighter/darker
* CSS length values - Shifts numeric length values up/down by 1 (units: em, in, px, pt, cm)
* Encoding/decoding of HTML special characters
* Single characters and string consisting from any amount of the same character can be shifted to the prev/next ASCII value
* Strings ending with numbers - increments/decrements the postfix
